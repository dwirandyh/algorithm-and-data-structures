### Algorithm and Data Structures

This repository contains source code that i have been using to learn about Algorithm and Data Structures that use javascript as programming language, but i also try to provide with another language too such as java, kotlin or other programming language.

### List of algorithm are:
- **Reverse Char**
  
  Given a string, return a new string with the reversed

- **Reverse Int**
  
  Given a Integer, return a new integer that is reversed

- **Palindrome**

  Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not.  Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed. *Do* include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome.
  ```sh
  //  Examples:
  palindrome("abba") === true
  palindrome("abcdefg") === false palindrome("abcdefg") === false
  ```
- **Max Char**

  Given a string, return the character that is most commonly used in the string.
